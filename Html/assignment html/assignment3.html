            Udaipur, formerly the capital of the Mewar Kingdom, is a city in the western Indian state of Rajasthan.
            Founded
            by
            Maharana Udai Singh II in 1559, it’s set around a series of artificial lakes and is known for its lavish
            royal
            residences. City Palace, overlooking Lake Pichola, is a monumental complex of 11 palaces, courtyards and
            gardens, famed for its intricate peacock mosaics.
