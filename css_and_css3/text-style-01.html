    <h1>Introduction of CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style HTML elements, controlling their appearance and layout on web pages. It separates the presentation from the content, making web design more efficient, consistent, and flexible. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, you can customize fonts, colors, spacing, and more. This allows you to create visually appealing and responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
